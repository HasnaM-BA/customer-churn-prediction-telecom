 📉 Predicting Customer Churn Using Machine Learning (Telecom Case Study)

This project was developed as part of my Master's thesis in **Business Analytics & Data Science** at Rabat Business School. The study focuses on addressing customer churn in the telecom industry using interpretable machine learning models.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a predictive churn model using real-world telecom customer data, helping companies anticipate and reduce customer loss through data-driven strategies.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📊 Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- 📌 Feature Engineering (Tenure/Charges ratio, etc.)  
- 🔁 Manual Oversampling to handle class imbalance  
- ✅ Model Training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- 📈 Model Evaluation using Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC AUC  
- 🔍 Explainability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)  
- 🔎 Feature Selection using RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination)

## 🧪 Models Used

| Model              | Accuracy | F1 Score | Notes                     |
|-------------------|----------|----------|---------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | 95%      | --       | Simple, interpretable     |
| Random Forest       | 94%      | --       | Strong baseline           |
| XGBoost             | 98%      | 0.97     | Best performance overall  |

---

## 🔍 Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- SHAP, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

---

## 🏁 Results & Conclusion

- **Tenure**, **Contract Type**, and **Referral Count** were top churn indicators.
- XGBoost showed the most reliable performance.
- SHAP improved transparency and interpretability.
- The model can help telecom companies like **Maroc Telecom**, **inwi**, and **Orange** act early on at-risk customers.
